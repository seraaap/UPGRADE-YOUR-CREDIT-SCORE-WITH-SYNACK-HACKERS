# UPGRADE-YOUR-CREDIT-SCORE-WITH-SYNACK-HACKER
I am Serap, and I live in Carlifonia I filed bankruptcy two years ago and have been rebuilding my credit since then. Last month my Equifax score from myFICO was 490. I had a secured loan from Navy fed for $4800 and paid $266.00 a month that was paid off on 7/22 then come August my credit score -21 points WITH (the reason was one of your accounts has decreased by $266.00) the loan paid on time every month never late and was at the end if it term. I have credit cards that are paid on time, or I completely pay off every month, but credit scores are still low, myFICO says my credit utilization is at 8%. I was able to employ the services of SYNACK SPECIALIST who helped me increase my credit scores to high 700s across the bureaus, all the negatives, liens, charge offs and BK removed. Just send a message to S Y N A C K H A C K @ T E C H -C E N T E R . C O M and thank me later.
